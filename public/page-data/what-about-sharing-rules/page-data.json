Whereas <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/whats-a-role/\">the role hierarchy</a> discussed previously allows for <strong><strong>vertical access</strong></strong>.</p><p>What’s lateral access? Well, it’s access that goes across the role hierarchy, rather than up or down. The very classic example is of two sales teams in two different regions, “Sales West” and “Sales East.” If they need access to each other’s records but are in the same level of the role hierarchy, we encounter a problem. This is where sharing rules come into the picture.</p><p>To utilize sharing rules, we ask three basic questions:</p><ul><li>Which records will we share?</li><li>Who will we share them with?</li><li>Do they need to read them, or edit them too?</li></ul><p>Let’s break this down by each question.</p><p><strong><strong>Which records will we share?</strong></strong></p><p>You can utilize criteria-based or ownership-based sharing rules. Ie. you can share records which meet pre-defined criteria, or who belong to a certain user or set of users.</p><p><strong><strong>Who will we share them with?</strong></strong></p><p>You can share with a role, a role and its subordinates, or a public group. This is important, because it means that sharing rules are not ideal for sharing single records with single users – that’s actually what manual sharing or account and opportunity teams are for.</p><p><strong><strong>Do they need to read them, or edit them too?</strong></strong></p><p>Perhaps the most important note here – if a record is shared with you via a sharing rule, you cannot delete it or change (transfer) its owner. You can grant read-only or read/write access only.</p><p>Okay, so what are the takeaways here? Remember that sharing rules are for <strong><strong>lateral access</strong></strong>, and to always ask yourself the three questions listed above.</p><p>That’s all, cheers! <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/conversations/\">Check out the other Conversations here.</a></p>","published_at":"July 10, 2019","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"},{"name":"conversations","slug":"conversations"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"what-about-sharing-rules","previous":{"slug":"whats-a-permission-set","title":"What's a Permission Set?","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"whats-an-api","title":"APIs & Beautiful...
