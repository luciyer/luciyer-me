How is it different from Process Builder?</h3><p>As I mentioned in our previous conversation about <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/whats-the-process-builder/\">the process builder</a>, Salesforce gives you several options for managing <em><em>workflow</em></em>.</p><p>To recap again for those who may not have read other posts, <em><em>workflow</em></em> is the term we use to refer to the automation tools Salesforce makes available, including process builder, flow builder, and approval processes.</p><p>In order to keep this conversation conversational, I don’t want to discuss the flow builder in technical detail, but rather to provide an idea of what it can be used to do.</p><p>Let’s say you’re a support agent at my fictional company which makes and sells sunglasses. The phone rings, a customer calling in to report that the hinge of their sunglasses has broken and that they’d like to send them in for a repair. Let’s say we have a custom object to track repairs, which we can relate to the case object. First, we need to create a case, then create a repair, and associate the two. How can we get this done?</p><p>Well, we could start by creating a new case manually, asking the customer for the relevant information. Then we could create a repair record, again asking the customer for the same information, relating the two records, hoping we hadn’t forgotten to fill in any information that is necessary.</p><p>So that’s one option, but it’s not the best options. Instead, we could…</p><h3 id=\"build-a-flow\">Build a Flow</h3><p>We can standardize these steps as well as the information we gather by asking our administrator to create a flow. Our administrator can set up a screen flow that prompts for information and does work behind the scenes as that information is entered.</p><p>So now, imagine the same support representative can launch a screen flow by clicking a button called “Initiate Repair,” and a series of successive screens prompt him or her for all the necessary information, creating and relating the correct objects without any risk of a required field going empty and creating a delay or issue with the repair itself.</p><p>You know what would be even cooler? If we could also expose that functionality directly to our customers via a customer community, so they could fill out the information themselves without the interaction with a support agent required. Self-service isn’t for everyone, but it’s pretty cool to offer the option, and building a flow can accomplish just that.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-process-builder\">It’s not Process Builder</h3><p>What’s the main difference? Let’s keep this simple.</p><p>Flows require user interaction – an input and output of information that ultimately provides a standardized way to accomplish a task such as creating a case, as we described earlier.</p><p>Process Builder, on the other hand, operates entirely behind the scenes without user interaction.</p><p>Now last but not least, I’ll tease you by mentioning that something really powerful happens when process builder and flow builder are combined. A flow can create a record, and then an instance of process builder can automatically fire to send off an email to the user to give them a link to track the status of their repair, for example. Or, a process builder instance can conditionally launch a flow – if a user updates and saves a record, now we can prompt that same user to complete a flow to provide more information.</p><p>That’s all, cheers! <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/conversations/\">Check out the other Conversations here.</a></p>","published_at":"August 05, 2019","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"},{"name":"conversations","slug":"conversations"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"flow-builder","previous":{"slug":"workflow-rules-wolf-or-sheep","title":"Workflow Rules: Wolf or Sheep?","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"cheatsheets","title":"Cert Exams?
