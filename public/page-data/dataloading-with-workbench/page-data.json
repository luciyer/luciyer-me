In fact, my first task ever working with Salesforce was to orchestrate the loading of over 2 million records into a demo Salesforce org. It was quite the trial by fire.</p><p>There are a number of different tools which can facilitate this process, all of which I hope to make videos for in the near future. My personal favorite, however, is <a href=\"http://sfdc.guide/posts/basics-of-workbench/\">Workbench</a>. It has no unnecessary frills and works fast and delivers any errors to you in a descriptive manner after attempting to complete the whole operation. In this video I show you how to load a list of nearly 800 leads into Salesforce in a matter of seconds, with no unnecessary software to download and few, if any, manipulations required to the raw data itself.</p><p>Oh, last note! I also made a video showing how I generated the mock data that I used in this video. I used a tool called Mockaroo, and I show you how in <a href=\"http://sfdc.guide/posts/generating-mock-data-with-mockaroo/\">this video</a>.</p><h4 id=\"video-breakdown\">Video Breakdown</h4><p>We will learn how toâ€¦</p><ol><li>Format a basic CSV file to load into Salesforce</li><li>Utilize Workbench to map CSV columns to object fields</li><li>Load our data and see the results!</li></ol><p>Hope this helps!</p>","published_at":"June 08, 2018","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dataloading-with-workbench","previous":{"slug":"formula-fields-and-cross-object-formula-fields","title":"Formula Fields and Cross-Object Formula Fields","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"generating-mock-data-with-mockaroo","title":"Generating Mock Data with Mockaroo","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}}}}}
