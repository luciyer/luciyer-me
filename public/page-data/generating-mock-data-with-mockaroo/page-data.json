When this happens, I find that using a tool called Mockaroo is often the quickest and easiest way; I can generate a schema which I can even save and reuse later and generate tons of records at once which I can later insert into Salesforce.</p><p>Cheers!</p>","published_at":"June 09, 2018","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"generating-mock-data-with-mockaroo","previous":{"slug":"dataloading-with-workbench","title":"Dataloading with Workbench","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"writing-batchable-schedulable-apex-code","title":"Writing Batchable, Schedulable Apex Code","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}}}}}
