A Sandbox provides a copy of your “production” (live) org so that you can really easily test in an environment that perfectly recreates the live org your users are in. Once a solution has been developed and tested in a Sandbox, it can be migrated to a production org using a Change Set.</p><p>Sandboxes come in different types and might be used for different purposes. For an overview of deployment best practices using Sandboxes, check out <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/pushing-changes-properly/\">Pushing Changes Properly</a>. For a deep dive into Sandboxes, their different types, how to create one, and how to develop something and migrate it to production, check out my post titled <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/sandboxes-the-hippocratic-oath/\">Sandboxes &amp; The Hippocratic Oath</a>.</p><p>That’s all, cheers! <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/conversations/\">Check out the other Conversations here.</a></p>","published_at":"June 28, 2019","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"whats-a-sandbox","previous":{"slug":"whats-a-profile","title":"What's a Profile?","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"object-relationships","title":"Object Relationships","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}}}}}
