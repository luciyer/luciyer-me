It is a product designed to help make sales representatives and sales teams more efficient and more effective. It includes some objects which are configured to suit a “standard” sales process: Leads, Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, and Campaigns, as well as Products, Pricebooks, Quotes, and Contracts.</p><p>As I’ve mentioned previously, these objects are related and are relatively agnostic so they may be utilized in a number of different scenarios with few or no customizations required.</p><p>In addition, Sales Cloud allows you to make some basic integrations like a <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/web-to-lead/\">“Web-to-Lead” form which you can embed in your website</a>, allowing you to capture leads directly to your Salesforce instance.</p><p>So, to make this clearer, let’s ask a practical question:<em><em> how might my hypothetical sunglasses business use Sales Cloud?</em></em></p><p>Let’s say I’m a Sales Rep, and a new lead enters from the “Contact Us” page of the website (this page is actually hosting a web-to-lead form that sends that data directly to Salesforce!). I can give that lead a call or send them an email to gauge their interest, perhaps moving them from a stage like “New” to “Prospecting,” or if the conversation goes very well, I may decide they’re interested to buy and I’ll convert them, automatically creating an Opportunity, Account, and Contact in the process.</p><p>As time goes on, I may have more conversations and ultimately sell some sunglasses to this customer, especially if they’re a eyewear shop and they want to make a big order, it’s going to help me a lot to have all of their information organized into objects and have a view of what actions I’ve taken, what meetings we’ve had, etc. If they end up buying, I’ll mark the opportunity “Closed Won,” and attach a Product to it, detailing how much they bought and of what.</p><p>Essentially, all of these tools should help your business to get a better handle on prospective and current customers, understand what was sold and to whom, and maintain those relationships through time.</p><p>Depending on your edition of Salesforce, you have access to more features and more storage, for example.
