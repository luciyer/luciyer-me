You might make an app to group tabs together which are often used together – like leads, opportunities, accounts, and contacts, which make up the core of a standard sales process.</p><p>Imagine a sales representative who just converted a lead to an opportunity, and now he or she wants to email one of the contacts on the related account to schedule a meeting.
