My goal here is that watching these videos, you can start to become more knowledgeable about the software industry and about Salesforce and about its many nuances.</p><p>I’ll usually try to answer the following high level questions:</p><ul><li>What problem does this solve for an organization?</li><li>Who might utilize this?</li></ul><p>The series will start with high-level concepts regarding technology, cloud computing, and salesforce itself. As we continue, we will begin to dive deeper into products, features, and specific functionalities.</p><p>I hope you guys enjoy this series and I am always curious to hear feedback as well as suggestions. I’d like to reaffirm that these videos will not include tutorials and screen captures – again, they’re simply conversations.</p><p>That’s all, cheers! <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/conversations/\">Check out the other Conversations here.</a></p>","published_at":"June 17, 2019","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"},{"name":"conversations","slug":"conversations"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-new-series-conversations","previous":{"slug":"admin-friendly-lightning-components-2","title":"Admin-Friendly Lightning Components","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"what-are-cloud-computing-and-saas","title":"What are Cloud Computing and SaaS?","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}}}}}
