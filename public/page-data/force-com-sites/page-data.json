Within production environments they’re pretty large: 40GB and 60 Usage Hours per 24 hour period. However, you should still be smart about making sure any Apex classes which are available aren’t particularly computationally heavy, and that you’re not serving, for some odd reason, images or videos.</p><p>To get around limits like these, you can use a CDN that caches your content as long as it is not very dynamic content.
