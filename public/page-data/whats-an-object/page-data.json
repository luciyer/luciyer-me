Simple as that.</p><p>Salesforce has standard objects, which come pre-assembled, like Leads, Opportunities, Contacts, and Accounts. But you can also make custom objects to suit your needs.</p><p>Now, imagine an excel spreadsheet, where each column is a “<strong><strong>field</strong></strong>” and each row is a “<strong><strong>record</strong></strong>.”</p><p>Let’s take an example. Again, say I run a company which sells sunglasses. One of the objects in my Salesforce instance is “Product.” Some fields on the Product object could be:</p><ul><li>Name</li><li>Price</li><li>Color</li><li>Lens Type</li><li>Lens Size</li></ul><p>So you can think about those fields as the columns on a spreadsheet, and each product would occupy a row with its own “<strong><strong>values</strong></strong>.”</p><p>Maybe I just designed a new pair of sunglasses called “<em><em>Berlin</em></em>” (or something hipster like that, obviously). I think I’m going to price them at <em><em>$95</em></em>. They’re <em><em>matte black</em></em> with <em><em>polarized lenses</em></em> of <em><em>49mm</em></em>.</p><p>These values, Berlin, $95, Matte Black, Polarized, 49mm are all the values of a record of my product object.</p><p>So let’s recap quickly:</p><ul><li>Object: A Database Table</li><li>Record: A single instance of an object, a <em><em>row</em></em> in the table</li><li>Field: One of the pieces of information stored, a <em><em>column</em></em> in the table.</li><li>Value: One of the attributes of a record, a <em><em>cell</em></em> in the table</li></ul><p>It’s a lot of information to digest, but it’s absolutely critical to understand and properly use the vocabulary explained above. If you have ever used a spreadsheet before, you’re already familiar with these concepts, I promise!</p><p>Want to learn a bit more about working with custom objects, and see a hands-on example?
