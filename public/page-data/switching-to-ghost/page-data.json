In parallel but independently, I've spent a good deal of time familiarizing myself with d3.js and building data visualizations. While building this site, I had my first foray into Gatsby and GraphQL, which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. </p><p>I'm using the additional free time I have during this never-ending Argentine quarantine (March 21, 2020 - Infinity ) to let myself be pulled in the direction I will be - I've been exposed to many different technologies and whatever excites me in the moment is what I pursue, knowing that eventually I'll put my hands on the wheel and pretend that I'd been steering the whole time. </p><p>More on this later.</p>","published_at":"June 14, 2020","tags":[{"name":"node","slug":"nodejs"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"switching-to-ghost","previous":{"slug":"flower-heatmap","title":"Flower Heatmap","primary_tag":{"name":"d3","slug":"d3js"}},"next":{"slug":"lunfard-ismo","title":"Lunfard + ismo","primary_tag":{"name":"node","slug":"nodejs"}}}}}
