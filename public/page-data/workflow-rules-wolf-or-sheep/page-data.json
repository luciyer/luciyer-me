And yeah, one of my most popular posts/videos ever is about <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/time-based-workflow-rules/\">Time-Based Workflow Rules</a>.</p><p>But workflow rules are my <em><em>nightmare</em></em>. I react with visceral fear to the very mention of adding another workflow rule, or when I go to update a set of records and it fails because some workflow rule goes haywire. I’m shuddering right now thinking about it. Let’s get this over with.</p><p>Wait, before we start (yes, I’m just delaying the inevitable), we need to mention that <em><em>workflow</em></em> and <em><em>workflow rule</em></em>s are not interchangeable terms. <em><em>Workflow</em></em> is <s>constantly</s> often redefined by Salesforce, but it refers to the entire collection of functionalities that provide automation (approval processes, workflow rules, flows, process builder). Obviously, <em><em>workflow rules</em></em> are a component of <em><em>workflow</em></em>.</p><p>Workflow rules allow you to automate business processes. They consist of criteria (when do I execute?) and actions (what do I do?). You can:</p><ul><li>Create a Task</li><li>Send an Email</li><li>Update a Field</li><li>Create an Outbound Message</li></ul><p>Sounds pretty great, right? <strong><strong>No!</strong></strong></p><p>I’m only being partially facetious when I say that workflow rules are wolves in sheep’s clothes. Just as you’d expect, they have all the power and majesty of wolves, and the approachable facade of a sheep. However, you also might invite them to spend the night in your barn, and wake up to find they’ve eaten all your chickens.</p><p>I know very little about barns and farm animals, so I hope that metaphor made sense.</p><h3 id=\"are-you-suggesting-not-to-use-workflow-rules\">Are you suggesting not to use Workflow Rules?</h3><p>Yes! Unequivocally. Mark your calendars, I’m insane.</p><p>If you’re a new administrator, do yourself a favor <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/whats-the-process-builder/\">learn the process builder</a>. If you’re an old administrator, attached to your workflow rules, suck it up and <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/whats-the-process-builder/\">learn the process builder</a>. Oh, and start migrating.</p><p>Why? Well that’s actually fodder for another post.</p><p>While I will concede there are still organization-specific use cases where workflow rules will <em><em>cause less headache</em></em>, that’s usually because there already exists a crazy, complex mesh of workflow rules. IE. you’re doubling down on a sunk cost by investing more; you’re buying a typewriter in 2019 because your office is already full of them, and you “don’t want to ruin the aesthetic.”</p><p>Salesforce has made it very clear that <em><em>workflow</em></em> now consists of process builder and flow builder, and workflow rules will “no longer be enhanced” (sounds like a slow goodbye to me). So yeah, all that and the fact that the process builder is a <em><em>lot</em></em> more powerful and extensible than workflow rules.</p><p>Need more links, more reasons?
