Check out that post <a href=\"http://sfdc.guide/posts/time-based-workflow-rules/\">here</a> for more information!</p><p>Here’s the anonymous Apex code we executed to perform a test of our business hours. Make sure to replace “<strong><strong>Eastern US</strong></strong>” with whatever you named your business hours.</p><pre><code class=\"language-java\">BusinessHours bh = [SELECT Id, Name FROM BusinessHours WHERE Name = 'Eastern US'];\n\n// 8 Hours * 60 Seconds * 60 Minutes * 1000 Milliseconds\nDatetime eightBusinessHours = BusinessHours.add(bh.Id, Datetime.now(), 8*60*60*1000);\n\n// A much simpler function!!\nDatetime eightCalendarHours = Datetime.now().addHours(8);\n\n\nSystem.debug('8 BUSINESS HOURS FROM NOW IS: ' + eightBusinessHours);\nSystem.debug('8 CALENDAR HOURS FROM NOW IS: ' + eightCalendarHours);</code></pre><p>And here’s the query itself, separated. You can use the “Query Editor” tab within the Developer Console to execute and see the results of queries, or you can use <a href=\"https://sfdc.guide/posts/basics-of-workbench/\">Workbench</a>. I prefer workbench because it gives you a nice interface to build a query, but for simple things like the following, the Developer Console is more than enough.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sql\">SELECT Id, Name FROM BusinessHours\n\nSELECT Id, Name FROM BusinessHours WHERE Name = 'Eastern US'</code></pre><p>Thanks for watching!</p>","published_at":"November 30, 2017","tags":[{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"getting-started-with-business-hours","previous":{"slug":"time-based-workflow-rules","title":"Time-Based Workflow Rules","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}},"next":{"slug":"basics-of-workbench","title":"Basics of Workbench","primary_tag":{"name":"salesforce","slug":"salesforce"}}}}}
